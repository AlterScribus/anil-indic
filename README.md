anil-indic
==========

Anil's version of scribus 1.5, patched for indic (indic requires advanced layout features but is not RTL)

Author : anilankv (at) g m a i l ! com

As for now, only the diff.

It was [initialy posted with following comment](http://lists.scribus.net/pipermail/scribus/2012-August/047258.html) :
' The patch for the development version ( as on 15the Aug 2012 ) is
available at http://www.atps.in/download/Scribus_1.5_indic.patch
The patched source tarball is available at
http://www.atps.in/download/Scribus_1.5_indic.tar.bz2' but these urls are now 404.

But it looks like it somehow evolved later on since there is another version here : https://github.com/AlterScribus/Notes-for-the-various-repos/blob/master/anil%27s%20scribus1.5-indic.patch  (same name slightly different sizes)
